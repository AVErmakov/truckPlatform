1. We've got searching form (emulated by createSearchRequest() in LoadsServiceInterface)
    or a new load in DB (for now newLoad() which generates random load).
2. Launch the checkLoad(), in which we call findPath() for every part of trip -
    empty to pick up, usefull and empty to finish point. It returns a cost of trip
        (if load's weight > allowable than return -1000)
